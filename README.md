# User's instruction
Let's launch the application locally. Clone this repository to your machine and go to its folder. Activate the virtual environment with commands.
```python
$ cd <file>
$ poetry install
$ poetry shell
```
The application requires a PostgreSQL database to run. In the root directory of the application, you must create a file called .env that defines environment variables with the following content:
```python
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://xxx
TEST_ENV=true
SECRET_KEY=random_string
```

Please note that, before starting the application for the first time, you must run the command of the database table used by the application:
```python
python3 src/db_helper.py
```

Use the following command to launch the application in the Poetry virtual environmentï¼š
```python
python src/index.py
